# ISS-Locator

This is a simple command line application that allows users to enter a past date and time (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM format) and
receives the location coordinates the International Space Station (ISS) was over at that moment, as well as its location every ten minutes before
and after that for an hour.

## Output
A world map visualizing the location of ISS. Hover mouse cursor over data points to display relevant information.
